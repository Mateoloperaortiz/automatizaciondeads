# lib/automation/audience_taxonomy.yaml
# Defines mappings from Python service primitives to standardized intermediate values.

# This is a simplified example. You'll expand this significantly.
# The idea is to map potentially varied string outputs from the ML service
# or cluster profiles into a more controlled set of intermediate targeting concepts.

# --- Industry Mappings --- #
# Maps an industry string (e.g., from cluster profile or zero-shot on ad text)
# to a standardized internal industry code/category.
industry_map:
  "Software Development": TECH_SOFTWARE_DEV
  "Technology": TECH_GENERAL
  "Sales": BIZ_SALES
  "Marketing": BIZ_MARKETING
  "Customer Support": OPS_CUSTOMER_SUPPORT
  "Healthcare": HEALTH_GENERAL
  "Finance": FIN_GENERAL
  "General": GENERAL_INDUSTRY # Fallback

# --- Skill Keyword Mappings (Illustrative) --- #
# This might be more complex in reality. You might have categories of skills.
# For now, we might just pass skill_keywords through, or map some common ones to broader categories.
skill_categories:
  PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE: # Example category
    - "Python"
    - "JavaScript"
    - "Java"
    - "TypeScript"
  CLOUD_PLATFORM:
    - "AWS"
    - "Azure"
    - "Google Cloud"
    - "GCP"
  DATABASE_TECH:
    - "SQL"
    - "PostgreSQL"
    - "MySQL"
    - "MongoDB"
    - "NoSQL"

# --- Location Mappings (Illustrative) --- #
# Maps common location strings to standardized location codes or types.
# Platform translators will handle converting these to platform-specific location IDs/geotargeting.
location_map:
  "Remote": LOCATION_REMOTE
  "USA": COUNTRY_US
  "United States": COUNTRY_US
  "San Francisco": CITY_SF_CA_US
  "New York": CITY_NY_NY_US
  "London": CITY_LONDON_UK

# --- Seniority Mappings --- #
seniority_map:
  "Entry-Level": SENIORITY_ENTRY
  "Junior": SENIORITY_JUNIOR
  "Mid-Level": SENIORITY_MID
  "Senior": SENIORITY_SENIOR
  "Lead": SENIORITY_LEAD
  "Manager": SENIORITY_MANAGER
  "Principal": SENIORITY_PRINCIPAL
  "Staff": SENIORITY_STAFF # Often similar to Principal or Lead

# --- Fallback/Default Audience (if segmentation confidence is low) --- #
# This could define a default set of broad targeting options.
# The structure here would be what your platform translators expect as input.
fallback_audience:
  industries: [GENERAL_INDUSTRY]
  locations: [COUNTRY_US] # Example default
  # No specific skills or seniority for broadest reach
