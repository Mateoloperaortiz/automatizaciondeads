# AdFlux Testing Overview

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy and approach for the AdFlux system.

## Testing Philosophy

The AdFlux testing strategy follows these key principles:

1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Testing is integrated throughout the development process, not just at the end.
2. **Automation First**: Automated tests are preferred over manual testing whenever possible.
3. **Pyramid Approach**: The test suite follows the testing pyramid with more unit tests than integration tests, and more integration tests than end-to-end tests.
4. **Realistic Testing**: Tests use realistic data and scenarios to validate system behavior.
5. **Continuous Testing**: Tests are run automatically as part of the continuous integration pipeline.

## Testing Pyramid

The AdFlux testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach:

```
    /\\
   /  \\
  /E2E \\
 /------\\
/        \\
/Integration\\
/------------\\
/              \\
/   Unit Tests   \\
/------------------\\
```

1. **Unit Tests**: Fast, focused tests that validate individual components in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**: Tests that validate interactions between components.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Tests that validate complete user workflows.

## Test Types

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, with dependencies mocked or stubbed. Key areas for unit testing include:

- Database models
- Service functions
- Utility functions
- API resources
- Form validation
- Machine learning components

Unit tests are implemented using pytest and are located in the `tests/unit` directory.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests validate interactions between components. Key areas for integration testing include:

- API endpoints
- Database operations
- External API clients
- Task queue operations
- Web forms

Integration tests are implemented using pytest and are located in the `tests/integration` directory.

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-End tests validate complete user workflows. Key areas for end-to-end testing include:

- User authentication and authorization
- Job opening management
- Campaign creation and publishing
- Candidate segmentation
- Performance reporting

End-to-End tests are implemented using pytest with Selenium for web interface testing and are located in the `tests/e2e` directory.

### Performance Testing

Performance tests validate the system's performance characteristics. Key areas for performance testing include:

- API response times
- Database query performance
- Task processing throughput
- Machine learning model training and prediction times

Performance tests are implemented using locust.io and are located in the `tests/performance` directory.

### Security Testing

Security tests validate the system's security controls. Key areas for security testing include:

- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation
- API security
- Data protection
- External API credential management

Security tests are implemented using a combination of automated tools and manual testing.

## Test Environment

### Local Development Environment

Developers run tests in their local development environment using:

- SQLite database for testing
- Mock external APIs
- Local Redis instance for Celery

### Continuous Integration Environment

Tests are run in the CI environment using:

- PostgreSQL database for testing
- Mock external APIs
- Redis instance for Celery

### Staging Environment

End-to-end tests are run in the staging environment using:

- PostgreSQL database
- Sandbox/test environments for external APIs
- Redis instance for Celery

## Test Data

### Test Fixtures

Test fixtures provide the necessary setup for tests, including:

- Database fixtures
- Authentication fixtures
- External API mock fixtures
- File system fixtures

Fixtures are defined in `tests/conftest.py` and in component-specific fixture files.

### Test Data Generation

Test data is generated using:

- Factory classes for model instances
- Faker library for realistic data
- Predefined test datasets

## Test Automation

### Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:

- Pull requests
- Merges to main branch
- Scheduled runs (nightly)

### Test Reporting

Test results are reported through:

- CI/CD pipeline reports
- Test coverage reports
- Performance test reports

## Test Coverage

The target test coverage for AdFlux is:

- **Unit Tests**: 90% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 80% code coverage
- **End-to-End Tests**: Coverage of all critical user workflows

## Responsibilities

### Developers

- Write unit tests for all new code
- Write integration tests for component interactions
- Run tests locally before submitting pull requests
- Fix failing tests

### QA Engineers

- Write end-to-end tests
- Perform exploratory testing
- Validate bug fixes
- Conduct performance and security testing

### DevOps Engineers

- Maintain test environments
- Configure CI/CD pipeline for testing
- Monitor test performance and stability

## Testing Tools

### Testing Frameworks

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **unittest.mock**: Mocking library
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **pytest-xdist**: Parallel test execution

### Web Testing

- **Selenium**: Browser automation
- **pytest-selenium**: Selenium integration for pytest
- **WebTest**: WSGI application testing

### API Testing

- **requests**: HTTP client
- **Flask Test Client**: Flask application testing

### Performance Testing

- **locust.io**: Load testing
- **pytest-benchmark**: Performance benchmarking

### Security Testing

- **bandit**: Security linting
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security scanner

## Test Execution

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run unit tests only
pytest tests/unit

# Run integration tests only
pytest tests/integration

# Run end-to-end tests only
pytest tests/e2e

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=adflux

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_models.py

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/unit/test_models.py::test_job_opening_model
```

### Running Tests in CI

Tests are automatically run in the CI pipeline as defined in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.

## Test Documentation

### Test Case Documentation

Test cases are documented in:

- Test function docstrings
- Test case management system (if applicable)

### Test Reports

Test reports are generated for:

- Test results (pass/fail)
- Code coverage
- Performance metrics

## Troubleshooting Tests

### Common Issues

- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure the test database is configured correctly
- **External API Mocking**: Verify that external APIs are properly mocked
- **Test Data**: Check that test data is properly set up
- **Test Isolation**: Ensure tests are properly isolated and don't affect each other

### Debugging Tests

- Use `pytest -v` for verbose output
- Use `pytest --pdb` to drop into debugger on test failure
- Use logging to capture additional information during test execution
