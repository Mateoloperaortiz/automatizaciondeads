# Service Layer Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

- [x] Create API configuration module
- [x] Implement base service layer
- [x] Set up standardized error handling
- [x] Build CampaignService as first feature service
- [x] Create refactored example of campaign-wizard.js

## Phase 2: Main Implementation (2-3 weeks)

### Week 1: Core Services
- [ ] Create additional feature services:
  - [ ] JobOpeningService
  - [ ] CandidateService 
  - [ ] SegmentService
  - [ ] AnalyticsService
  - [ ] AuthService
- [ ] Add service factory for dependency injection
- [ ] Implement request interceptors for auth tokens

### Week 2: Migration Planning
- [ ] Identify all pages using direct API calls
- [ ] Prioritize pages by complexity/importance
- [ ] Create migration plan with timeline
- [ ] Document migration patterns and examples

### Week 3: First Migrations
- [ ] Refactor high-priority pages to use service layer
- [ ] Add integration tests for services
- [ ] Update documentation with new examples
- [ ] Create monitoring for API errors

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Caching
- [ ] Implement request caching layer
- [ ] Add cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Create optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Add offline support capabilities

### Week 2: WebSockets
- [ ] Create WebSocketService for real-time updates
- [ ] Implement reconnection strategies
- [ ] Add message queue for offline mode
- [ ] Create event system for cross-component updates

## Phase 4: Finalization (1 week)

- [ ] Complete all page migrations
- [ ] Final testing and QA
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Remove legacy API calls
- [ ] Update final documentation

## Migration Strategy

1. **Step-by-step Approach:**
   - Start with simpler pages/components
   - Use the refactored campaign-wizard as a reference
   - Test thoroughly after each migration

2. **Temporary Compatibility Layer:**
   - Create utility functions that work with both old and new approaches
   - Allow gradual migration without breaking existing functionality

3. **Code Reviews:**
   - Require service layer usage in code reviews
   - Provide feedback and guidance for proper implementation

## Benefits Timeline

- **Immediate:** Better error handling, centralized endpoints
- **Short-term:** Reduced duplication, improved maintainability
- **Medium-term:** More consistent UX, better error recovery
- **Long-term:** Improved performance, offline capabilities, real-time updates
